# Game Project Description
This scenario has the player exploring a forest where they're collecting resources to bring back to their cabin to protect themselves against monsters when night falls. The player can walk, sprint, jump, crouch, pick up items, and interact with certain objects. They can pick up resources like firewood, planks, and tools to use in their cabin. There is no combat, so the player has to either run or hide from the monsters. The player has to go through a single day and survive until morning without getting caught by the monsters.

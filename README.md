# Group Formation
Christopher Dupas - Will work on everything required for this project, including the singleton, command, and factory design pattern, as well as the scenario creation and video report (100%) <br>
I initially tried to form a group with two people who are also in my GDW team, but they already had a third member. So I asked if I could join as a fourth member, however even though they all agreed to it they couldn’t come up with a reason for having four people in the group. I was okay with this decision because they said they weren’t connecting this project with our GDW game, which I was planning on doing, so I’m working on this project by myself. <br>

# Game Project Description
This scenario has the player exploring a forest where they're collecting resources to bring back to their cabin to protect themselves against monsters when night falls. The player can walk, sprint, jump, crouch, pick up items, and interact with certain objects. They also have a flashlight that they can toggle on and off. They can pick up resources like firewood, planks, and food to use in their cabin. There is no combat, so the player has to either run or hide from the monsters. The player has to go through a single day and survive until morning without getting caught by the monsters. The game can be quit at any time by pressing the escape key.

# Singleton
I created a UIManager to implement my singleton, which controls the different elements of my game's UI. I created a custom game instance blueprint, called "UIGameInstance", which implements different functions to control the player's health and stamina, as well as a timer. When the player collides with an enemy, the enemy blueprint will call a "TakeDamage" event from the player's blueprint, which then triggers the "ChangeHealth" function from my game instance which lowers the player's health by a certain amount. If the player's health reaches 0, then the level will restart. For the player's stamina, whenever the player is sprinting, the "DecreaseStamina" function will be called, which continually reduces the player's stamina as long as they are sprinting. If the player isn't sprinting, then the "IncreaseStamina" function will be called, which will gradually bring the player's stamina back up to its full amount. If the player runs out of stamina, they will automatically stop sprinting. For the game timer, the "UpdateTimer" function is used, which is called every frame by the UI blueprint. A float variable, timer, has the frame's delta time subtracted from it to update its value for that particular frame.

# Factory
I created a factory to spawn in different items that the player can pick up and add to their inventory, including firewood, wooden planks, and fruit. The "BP_ItemBase" class is the abstract product that creates the items that will be spawned, and implements the logic for the items to be picked up by the player and have the items added to their inventory. The concrete products are the "BP_Firewood" class, the "BP_WoodenPlank" class, and the "BP_Fruit" class. The "BP_ItemSpawner" is the abstract factory that implements the logic to spawn the items, which is done in this class as each object is spawned in the exact same way. It uses a public variable called "Item Class" to determine which object will be spawned in. The concrete factories are the "BP_ItemSpawner_Firewood" class, the "BP_ItemSpawner_WoodenPlank" class, and the "BP_ItemSpawner_Fruit" class, which overwrites the "Item Class" variable with that specific item's blueprint class. Lastly, a game manager is used to make the items spawn in using public variables as references to each item spawner in the level. Some items are spawned in when the level first loads, but when the player approaches a tree, more items will spawn nearby due to the player touching a collider that calls the function "SpawnItemsByTree" in the game manager.

# Command
I created a command that controls the player's flashlight, which is represented by a spotlight component in the player blueprint. When the player presses the 'F' key, their flashlight will toggle on if it's off, and will toggle off if it's on. There are 2 commands defined in the command interface, those being "Execute", which turns the flashlight on, and "Undo", which reverts the flashlight back to being off. The "BP_FlashlightToggleCommand" blueprint implements the logic required to perform the specific tasks of each command, and overrides the functions defined in the interface. It sets the intensity of the spotlight component to a specific value for each command. It also uses a "Target Actor" variable for the object that the commands will affect, which is the player. The "BP_Invoker" blueprint creates functions for each command and calls the specific command that's being requested. The "BP_Player" blueprint is the receiver, meaning it's the actor that's affected by the commands, and it also handles the player input that triggers the commands. It uses a "Flashlight On" bool variable that determines which command will be invoked using a branch node. Lasly, in the level blueprint the command object get spawned and has the player assigned to its "Target Actor" variable, then the command object and invoker get set to specific variables to ensure that they aren't null.

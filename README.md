# Game Project Description
This scenario has the player exploring a forest where they're collecting resources to bring back to their cabin to protect themselves against monsters when night falls. The player can walk, sprint, jump, crouch, pick up items, and interact with certain objects. They can pick up resources like firewood, planks, and tools to use in their cabin. There is no combat, so the player has to either run or hide from the monsters. The player has to go through a single day and survive until morning without getting caught by the monsters.
# Singleton
I created a UIManager to implement my singleton, which controls the different elements of my game's UI. I created a custom game instance blueprint, called "UIGameInstance", which implements different functions to control the player's health and stamina, as well as a timer. When the player collides with an enemy, the enemy blueprint will call a "TakeDamage" event from the player's blueprint, which then triggers the "ChangeHealth" function from my game instance which lowers the player's health by a certain amount. If the player's health reaches 0, then the level will restart. For the player's stamina, whenever the player is sprinting, the "DecreaseStamina" function will be called, which continually reduces the player's stamina as long as they are sprinting. If the player isn't sprinting, then the "IncreaseStamina" function will be called, which will gradually bring the player's stamina back up to its full amount. If the player runs out of stamina, they will automatically stop sprinting. For the game timer, the "UpdateTimer" function is used, which is called every frame by the UI blueprint. A float variable, timer, has the frame's delta time subtracted from it to update its value for that particular frame, and when the timer reaches 0, the level will change.
